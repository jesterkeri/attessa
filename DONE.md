## T00 - YYYY-MM-DD
commit: <sha>
verified: <the exact command that was run>
output:
```
<the real output, pasted, not summarised>
```
reviewed: reviews/gate-N-review.md | verdict: implementation-ready | C0 M1 m3
notes: <anything discovered that changed the design>

The `reviewed:` line is required. Code built by Claude Code is reviewed by Codex,
never by the model that wrote it. If a task genuinely needed no independent review,
write `reviewed: n/a (<why>)` so the decision is visible rather than missing.

reviewed: pending (adversary, then Codex; verdict appended as a new entry)
notes: attempt 1 failed (rootDir in the shared tsconfig resolved to the repo root); fixed per package. Rust 1.98.1 pinned; locally it is a hardlink of the installed stable 1.98.1 because the rustup download stalled. esbuild install script is skipped by the pnpm allowlist (only better-sqlite3, keytar may run scripts).

## T02 adversary fix - 2026-10-29
commit: 1eb99f7
findings: (1) AGENTS.md lint failed, no package had a lint script; (2) pnpm 9 ran esbuild postinstall, allowlist only in pnpm-workspace.yaml. Fixed: lint script per package; allowlist moved to package.json pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies; engines.pnpm >=10.32.1. Probes kept: scripts/check-agents-commands.sh, scripts/check-install-scripts.sh.
verified: ./scripts/check-install-scripts.sh && ./scripts/check-agents-commands.sh && <T02 verify>

notes: pnpm 10 control (same probe with pnpm@10.32.1) prints PASS. Not fixed (unproven suspicions, logged in task.md): cross-package typecheck needs a build or project references once packages import each other; tests outside src/ are not typechecked; contracts/foundry.lock untracked.

## T02 Codex r1 fixes - 2026-10-30
commit: this entry
review: .worktrees/review-t02-r1/reviews/t02-review-r1.md (VERDICT: changes required, M2 m1)
fixed:
- M2 Foundry pin: contracts/FOUNDRY_VERSION = v1.8.1 (forge 1.8.1, commit 982849d); the proposed ci.yml installs that version.
- m1 scripts/check-install-scripts.sh passes on a failed install only for ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE; any other failure exits 1.
- M1 CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml with the PIPELINE jobs ts, contracts, slither, enclave is proposed in .worktrees/prompts/ci.yml (the guard-edit hook keeps workflow files for Joshua to apply), plus harness-r2.patch removing the duplicate build job from harness.yml.
verified: bash scripts/check-install-scripts.sh (normal) and the same with npm offline and an empty cache
output:
```
$ bash scripts/check-install-scripts.sh
install refused by the engines pin (exit 1): ok
exit=0
$ npm_config_offline=true npm_config_cache=$(mktemp -d) bash scripts/check-install-scripts.sh
FAIL: install failed for another reason (exit 1); no evidence either way:
npm error code ENOTCACHED
exit=1
```
reviewed: pending (Codex r2, after ci.yml is applied)

## T02 Codex r1 fixes: full offline-probe output - 2026-10-30
The entry above abridged the offline run. Verbatim rerun:
```
FAIL: install failed for another reason (exit 1); no evidence either way:
npm error code ENOTCACHED
npm error request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pnpm failed: cache mode is 'only-if-cached' but no cached response is available.

## T02 adversary rounds 4-11 - 2026-10-31
Adversary rounds 4 to 10 each found a defect in the two CI guard scripts, each fixed with its test committed under scripts/adversary-t02-r*/ (15 tests, all rc=0 at 0ebb889). Joshua chose allow-lists on 2026-10-30, so scripts/check-workflows.sh and scripts/check-install-scripts.sh now accept only what this repo uses today:
- check-workflows.sh: fixed top-level, trigger, job and step keys; actions pinned by full sha with their current inputs only; `${{ }}` only in env values and a few listed places; `runs-on` exactly ubuntu-latest; checkout with persist-credentials false; bounded timeout-minutes and working-directory.
- check-install-scripts.sh: manifests read as git blobs and must be regular files; no pnpmfile, .npmrc, .gitattributes, .corepack.env, package.yaml/json5 or tracked node_modules; pnpm fixed at 10.32.1 and fetched outside the tree under test; every lockfile resolution a default-registry integrity; allowlisted builds need a pinned integrity.
Two Slither guard changes to ci.yml were applied by Joshua (5c0a049, 8612448). Round 11, on 0ebb889: no defect found.
